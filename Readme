For now,
Zeneng's code is in the master branch folder "Analysis_API"
Steve's code is in the master branch folder "GUI"
Xi's code is in the branch XP.

Zeneng is using an exogenous API wrapper to quickly get the stock price data so that he could has the input for his analysis class.
Xi is working on her own API class to get the stock price data. 
The two API classes will be put into one class finally.
